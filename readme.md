### Super Smash Bros Machine Learning Project

*Goal*: To create a neural network powerful enough to monitor smash gameplay in real-time

*Steps*:
1. Solder PCB board that can relay PC controller commands to the Nintendo Switch (done)
2. Create a library of macros for every character in the game (in progress)
3. Train real-time object recognition neural network to identify characters

### Smash Bros Macros

*Goal*: To create an automated way to extract training data from super-smash bros.

board to forward commands from my PC to the Switch!
